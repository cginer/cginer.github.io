Activities
------------

I participated in the organization of several activities for students in Bioinformatics and Population Genetics. Most of them were organized from within [RSG-Spain](http://www.rsg-spain.iscbsc.org), a bioinformatics student group recognized by the [ISCB Student Council](https://www.iscbsc.org). I've been an active member since 2014 and acted as president during 2016-2018.
