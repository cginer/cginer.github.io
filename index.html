<h1>Hi, I'm Carla!</h1>

<p>I obtained my PhD in Genetics in 2018 from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. Before that, I completed a a BSc in Biotechnology, where I learned about the complexity of life, and a MSc in Bioinformatics, where I learned how to use computers to study it.</p>

<p>My recent research has been focused on human polymorphic 
inversions and their role in the evolution of our species, based at Mario Cáceres lab (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona). During my undergraduate years I had some smaller contributions to other projects, the most important one being the characterization of a source of pluripotent stem cells in adults, at Universitat Internacional de Catalunya.</br>

<p>I enjoy teaching and learning from my students. I've had the opportunity to teach several undergraduate and master modules, from genomics practical sessions to programming and data visualisation courses.</br>

<p>In 2014, while studying for my PhD, I got involved with the local Bioinformatics student group. I learned a lot and had fun organizing scientific meetings, workshops and social events with other motivated students, aiming to make the Bioinformatics community in Spain stronger.</br>
