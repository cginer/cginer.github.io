<h1>Hi, I'm Carla!</h1>

<p>I'm currently a visiting postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/computational-molecular-biology/">Center for Computational Molecular Biology</a> (<a href="">Brown University</a>) at Emilia Huerta-Sanchez lab.</p>

<p>I obtained my PhD in Genetics in 2017 from <a href="https://www.uab.cat">Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</a>. Before that, I completed a <a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/ehea-degrees/general-information-1216708259085.html?param1=1231314915924">BSc in Biotechnology</a>, where I learned about the complexity of life, and a <a href="https://mscbioinformatics.uab.cat/">MSc in Bioinformatics</a>, where I learned how to use computers to study it.</p>

<p>My recent research has been focused on human polymorphic inversions and their role in the evolution of our species, based at <a href="http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/cacereslab/">Mario Cáceres lab</a> in the <a href="https://ibb.uab.cat/">Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina</a>. During my undergraduate years I had some smaller contributions to other projects, the most important one being the characterization of a source of pluripotent stem cells in adults, at <a href="https://www.uic.es/en">Universitat Internacional de Catalunya</a>.</br>

<p>I enjoy teaching and learning from my students. I've had the opportunity to teach several undergraduate and master modules, from genomics practical sessions to programming and data visualisation courses.</br>

<p>In 2014, while studying for my PhD, I got involved with the local <a href="http://www.rsg-spain.iscbsc.org/">Bioinformatics student group</a>. I learned a lot and had fun organizing scientific meetings, workshops and social events with other motivated students, aiming to make the Bioinformatics community in Spain stronger.</br>
